## Software Engineer Challenge

The objective of this challenge is to hit some endpoints containing a list of clinics and perform some actions on the result.


The list of clinics can be found at:

https://storage.googleapis.com/scratchpay-code-challenge/dental-clinics.json

https://storage.googleapis.com/scratchpay-code-challenge/vet-clinics.json


#### Create a RESTful API to **allow search** in multiple clinic providers and display results from all the available clinics by any of the following:

- Clinic Name
- State [ex: "CA" or "California"]
- Availability [ex: from:09:00, to:20:00]

This is including search by multiple criteria in the same time like search by state and availability together.

## What we are looking for

- **Simple, clear, readable code** How well structured it is? Clear separation of concerns? Can anyone just look at it and get the idea to
what is being done? Does it follow any standards?
- **Correctness** Does the application do what it promises? Can we find bugs or trivial flaws?
- **Security** Are there any obvious vulnerability?
- **Memory efficiency** How will it behave in case of large datasets?
- **Testing** How well tested your application is? Can you give some metrics?
- **Documentation** Is the code self documented and it's easy to understand it by just reading? 

## Nice To Have
- Implementation for any CI tool for the project.
- Project Dockerization.

## Conditions
- The challenge must be solved in Golang >= 1.13.
- Do not use any database or any full text search engines.
- Write full test using any test suite.
- If you make any assumptions, mention them clearly in the readme file.

## Commit History
Use whatever development workflow works best for you. If your solution is small enough and a single commit is justified, that's fine; we just ask that you keep your commit history as coherent as possible.

## Delivery
The challenge solution should be delivered as a link to a public git repository (github.com or bitbucket.com are preferred).


## Note
The goal is not to finish everything 100%. Quality > Quantity.


Good luck!
